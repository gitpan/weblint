Weblint is a syntax and minimal style checker for HTML: a Perl script which
picks fluff off HTML pages, much in the same way traditional lint picks fluff
off C programs.

Changes are summarized below, see the ChangeLog file in the distribution for
more detail.

As ever, I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to this release,

			Changes in Weblint 1.015


    *	New extension `Microsoft' -- the HTML extensions supported
	by Internet Explorer.

    *	Local site configuration file now supported. You have to set the

		$SITE_DIR

	variable to a directory which contains a file "global.weblintrc".
	There will be configuration support in later releases.

    *	If you have a personal configuration file, you can include the
	local site configuration settings with the sequence:

		use global weblintrc

    *	Changed the 'netscape-markup' warning to a more generic
	'extension-markup' warning, and the 'netscape-attribute' warning
	to a more generic 'extension-attribute' warning. The same warning
	is generated if you use Netscape markup, or Microsoft markup.

    *	new configuration variable 'file-extensions', for list of filename
	extensions when recursing in directories. Defaults to "html, htm".

    *	now warn about leading whitespace in list items.

    *	Attribute format checks added:

	    ATTRIBUTE		VALUES
	    ---------		-------------------------------------------
	    CLEAR		LEFT, RIGHT, ALL
	    TYPE		DISC, CIRCLE, SQUARE, A, a, I, i, 1 (added)
	    <color attributes>	Color attributes are now checked for hex
				color values. For Microsoft, color names are
				also supported. Color attributes are: BGCOLOR,
				ALINK, VLINK, LINK, TEXT, COLOR, BORDERCOLOR,
				BORDERCOLORLIGHT, and BORDERCOLORDARK.

    *	FONT and BASE elements now expected to have at least one attribute.

    *	Weblint is now smarter about picking a temporary working directory.

    *   Fixed the attribute format code so the ROWS and COLS attributes
        for FRAMESET are supported when the Netscape extension is enabled.

    *	Fixed bug where setting the `url-get' variable in your config file
	would not be seen when using the -todo switch.

    *	The ID, LANG, and CLASS attributes are now recognized for all font
	elements (B, I, STRONG, EM, etc).

    *	-f command-line switch added, for providing a config file.

    *	Weblint now warns about illegal syntax in the config file.
	Previously it would be silently ignored.

    *	Weblint now lets you have empty TD elements in a table.

    *	Fixed some typos in the man page.
