Weblint is a syntax and minimal style checker for HTML: a Perl script which
picks fluff off HTML pages, much in the same way traditional lint picks fluff
off C programs.

There were a couple of small bugs reported with 1.019, fixed in this release.

neilb

    *	Weblint was incorrectly warning that OPTION is not a container element

    *	The -U switch was no longer displayed the help screen.
	The help screen was referred to the old "Java" extension.

    *	Performance improvement when recursively checking files in a directory
