Weblint is a syntax and minimal style checker for HTML: a Perl script which
picks fluff off HTML pages, much in the same way traditional lint picks fluff
off C programs.

This version was released to make an official version available with
support for HTML 3.2 and the extensions from Microsoft (v4) & Netscape (v4).

This is the last version which will support Perl 4. Modulo any serious bugs,
the next version will be 2.0, which is a major rewrite, and requires Perl 5.
