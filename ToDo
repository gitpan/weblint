                        Weblint ToDo list - Weblint 1.015


    o	Time for a rewrite -- the code is nasty!


    o	Rewrite in perl 5 -- the data structures will be much easier. This
	will have to wait until Perl 5 is more stable, with stable ports
	for Mac and PCs.


    o	A Weblint.pm module for perl 5?


    o	Verbose option to give longer warnings with example syntax.


    o	build list of external links, for optional check at end.


    o   check if any file in a directory hierarchy is not referenced.


    o	Misuse of meta-characters, such as <, >, and ".
		(Barry Bakalor <barry@hal.com>)


    o	check for http://foo.com/nar/tar.gz!


    o	option to spell-check text (Clay Webster <clay@unipress.com>)


    o	option to specify level of HTML (0, 1, or 2)


    o	option to understand server-side includes, e.g.:
		<!inc srv "/Header.html">


    o	entity checks (Axel Boldt).


    o	bad-link check gets confused if given a path with directories in it,
	such as foo/bar/fred.html (Barry Bakalor)


    o	Use a DTD!


    o	Option to spit out the HTML source annotated with SGML comments
	which contain any weblint warnings. Tom Neff <tneff@panix.com>
	This will be: set message-style = inline -- neilb


    o	Support for weblint directives in SGML comments.
	Tom Neff <tneff@panix.com>


    o	A standardized "Weblint approved" snippet of HTML to put in pages.
	This would also be a link to the weblint home page.
	Tom Neff <tneff@panix.com>


    o	Flag places where use of <P> is redundant, and considered bad style;
	such as following a <H?>.  See "Composing Good HTML".


    o	Illegal context check, such as <P> appearing in <H1> ... </H1>
	Jokinen Jyke <jyke@cs.tut.fi>, Axel Boldt.


    o	Check for existence of files with:
		<IMG src="missing.gif" alt="Missing Image">
		<BODY background="missing.gif">
	as it already does with:
		<A HREF="missing.html">missing thing</A>
	(Barry Bakalor <barry@hal.com>)


    o	Give a more helpful message when <A NAME="..."> is not closed.


    o	The following is legal HTML, but weblint complains:
		<img alt = "> FOO <" src = "foo.gif">
	Reported by Abigail <abigail@mars.ic.iaf.nl>


    o	Check that HREF and other URLs are syntactically correct.
	For example:
		<LI><A HREF="ftp:sqn35.exe">Download SquareNote V3.5 Now.</A>  
	This HREF is invalid.  Larry Virden <lvirden@cas.org>


    o	Font change stylistic errors, for example in netscape:
		<b>
		<center><h1>text to be centered</h1></center>
		<center><h1>more text to be centered</h1></center>
		</b>

	html-check (sgmls) at least says that the problem is that a center tag
	turns off the bold tag.  Also, the header also turned off bold as well.
	By changing the code to:
	    <h1 align="center"><strong>text to be centered</strong></h1>
	    <h1 align="center"><strong>more text to be centered</strong></h1>
	html-check/sgmls indicated the code was better formed.
	Larry Virden <lvirden@cas.org>

    o	Get descriptions of how to use weblint on non-Unix platforms,
	such as Mac, MSDOS, Windows, etc.

    o	Try downloading the .tar.gz distribution via netscape;
	some people have experienced problems with this.


    o	Have a basic form, and one with toggles for all the warnings,
	and other options.


    o	Better handling of the fact that the HTML, HEAD, and BODY
	tags are optional.


    o	Adopt a common scheme for bits of weblint documentation,
	so that manpage, README, and web pages can share common text.
	Something based on SGML is the way to go. That way I could also
	generate ascii and html versions of everything.


    o	Automate appropriate parts of the release process.


    o	Better coverage of announcement of new versions:
	     -	standard format for announcements
	     -	hit more places, as listed in URL announce FAQ


    o	Crontab set up to create todo/history file for weblint,
	based on ToDo and ChangeLog files in my work version.


    o	I'm only new to HTML, but I think you shouldn't have
	<ul>'s within <p> ... </p>: weblint doesn't pick this. I
	think your Todo list covers this, though...
	Frank Steinke <fsteinke@zeta.org.au>


    o	A web document I have mentions <cmd> and <arg> as
	components of HTML+, but weblint doesn't know these.
	Frank Steinke <fsteinke@zeta.org.au>


    o	Also, I accidently marked two items as CHECKED on a <input type=radio>
	construct and weblint didn't flag it for me.  Netscape treated like
	a checkbox construct but then wouldn't let me deselect the items.
	Bruce Speyer <bspeyer@texas-one.org>


    o	I however want to be able to check for SGML style processing tags
	(for example <?MIVAR> <?/MIVAR>) and they appear to break weblint.

	The only syntax difference I want is to be able to use tags that have
	a question mark after the leading "<". This notation signifies a
	processing tag in SGML - I dont know alot about SGML either,
	that was all I needed to know :)

	Sean Riley <sean@illustra.com>


    o	I believe an INPUT tag with TYPE=image may also contain at least some
	of the attributes associated with the IMG tag, such as ALIGN, BORDER,
	HEIGHT, and WIDTH.  Weblint incorrectly flags these as errors.  I don't
	think ALT, ISMAP, or USEMAP would make sense.
	Barry Bakalor <barry@hal.com>


    o	html-check claims that if one has an open <FONT> tag and then
	encounters a <P>, the open FONT is assumed closed.  This wasn't
	a condition caught by weblint.  Just thought I would mention it.
	Larry W. Virden <lvirden@cas.org>


    o	I think a demo html file would be useful for demonstrating the tool.
	I wanted to demonstrate to prospective users what it could do for
	them so I created a very basic badsyntax.html file by looking at the
	comments in the weblintrc file and creating bad code for those
	conditions:
		<TOTLE>test page </Title>
		<H2>Hello</H2>
		Click <A HREF=index.html>here</A> to switch to another link
		<HR>
		<H1></H1>
		<H1></H2>
		</H3>fjkejfkdsjf</H3>
	Doug Grinbergs <dougg@qualcomm.com>


    o	I'd like a setting to optionally mandate "</p>" follow "<p>"
	Michael P. Gerlek <gerlek@dat.cse.ogi.edu>


    o	Perhaps when you encounter the empty container element you could
	suggest that the user change the p to a br? I think folk are often
	using a paragraph element instead of the more correct break line tag.
	Larry W. Virden <lvirden@cas.org>


    o	Add a 'spinner' extension to support the Spinner markup.


    o	Count the total number of lines in the file (or files in the case of
	recursive descent of directories), then count the number of warnings.
	Then compute a score for the file or files using a formula something
	like this:

		SCORE = ((#lines - #warns) / (#lines)) * 100

	It's technically possible for a really bad file to get a negative
	score, which is something I don't like, but I thought it would be
	an interesting (though probalby useless) feature.

	I also propose that it only be considered a valid measure when used
	in conjunction with pedantic.
	Jeremy Worley <jworley@khoral.com>


    o	The attribute format check should be element sensitive, since some
	attributes can take different values when used in different elements,
	such as the ALIGN attribute. When we move over to perl 5 this will
	be easier to do, thanks to the improved data structure support.


    o	SUB and SUP take one set of attributes in MATH mode, and
	a different set when used outside MATH mode. See the comment above
	for the attribute format check. Maybe I'll just go to perl 5 now . . .


    o	Add a timing testsuite -- similar the the current testsuite,
	but which allows me to keep track of performance changes.
	Every time a new warning or feature is added, it slows weblint down.
	It's gonna be time for a performance tuning release again soon :-)


    o	You signal that COORDS is required for a SHAPE=DEFAULT <<AREA>
	specification. This is incorrect as none is needed.

	Bill Merrow <bmerrow@ix.netcom.com>


    o	Just wanted to let you know the latest version of weblint
	doesn't support "BORDER=0" in:

		<INPUT TYPE="image" NAME="SearchButton" BORDER=0
		SRC="/at/pictures/AT-search_button.gif">

	such a page can be seen in http://mistral.enst.fr/at/ for instance.

	Nicolas Pioch <pioch@email.enst.fr>


    o	Weblint doesn't generate a warning if you have an empty list
	item (LI) at the end of a list. For example:
		<UL>
		<LI>First item
		<LI>Second item
		<LI>
		</UL>

    o	sometimes error message has funny '//' when scanning a directory,
	like:
		(/home/tristan/public_html//html):
			directory does not have an index file (index.html)

	Tristan Savatier <tristan@creative.net>


    o	Classify each warning as one of:
	    -	Syntax Error
	    -	Portability
	    -	Stylistic
	and similar. Be able to specify that only syntax errors be generated.


    o	Internationalization support
