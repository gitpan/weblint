1.020

    *	Weblint would warn that OPTION is not a container element,
	when it is. You now get a warning if an OPTION is empty.
	Reported by Richard L. Hawes <rhawes@dmapub.dma.org>

    *	The -U switch was no longer displayed the help screen.
	The help screen was referred to the old "Java" extension.
	Reported by Lars Balker Rasmussen <lbr@mjolner.dk>

    *	Added /o to a pattern match in the wanted() subroutine. wanted()
	is called many times when doing recursive checks in directories;
	this will have a performance improvement.
	Suggested by: Jason Mathews <mathews@nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov>
