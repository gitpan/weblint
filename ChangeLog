1.015

    28-april-1996 neilb

    *	Man page now includes a summary of weblint features, rather than
	a list of all warnings, since it was getting over long.

    *	Went through and capitalized all references to Netscape, Microsoft,
	and Java. Pointed out by Doug Grinbergs <dougg@qualcomm.com>

    *	Added /temp to the list of possible working directories for
	the testsuite. I had added this to weblint earlier, but forgot
	to update the testsuite.

    *	Only changes for the current release will be included in the
	Changelog which appears in the distribution, for size reasons.
	The home page will still have changes from all releases.

    20-april-1996 neilb

    *	released 1.015 beta

    8-april-1996 neilb

    *	The testsuite now throws a newline after every 70 tests.

    *	Added '/temp' to the list of directories to try when looking for
	a working directory. Apparently this is more likely to exist on
	PCs. Suggested by Keith Iosso <a-keithi@microsoft.com>

    *	Added an attribute format check for BGCOLOR, ALINK, VLINK, LINK,
	and TEXT for Netscape and Microsoft extensions. For Microsoft,
	COLOR, BORDERCOLOR, BORDERCOLORLIGHT, and BORDERCOLORDARK are
	also supported. The Microsoft color set is also understood
	when checking attribute values.

    *	released 1.015 alpha

    7-april-1996 neilb

    *	Added a new configuration variable 'file-extensions',
	which is used to provide a list of valid filename extensions
	used to identify files which should be checked when recursing
	in directories. For example:

		set file-extensions = html, htm

	Defaults to the list shown above.

    *	Weblint now warns about leading whitespace in list items.
	Netscape will produce jagged looking lists if some, but not all,
	list items have leading whitespace. Added test case.

    *	Added an attribute format check for the CLEAR attribute,
	which can take values LEFT, RIGHT, or ALL. Added test-case.

    *	Weblint now supports TYPE attribute values of "disc", "circle",
	and "square". These can be used with UL and LI to specify the
	type of bullet. Added test case for each of these.
	Reported by Gerald Viers <grviers@csupomona.edu>
	Patch from Phil Hooper <hooper@bcci.eng.sun.com>

    *	The FONT and BASE elements added to the list of elements where
	at least one attribute is expected, but no single attribute is
	required. Added test cases.
	Suggested by Tristan Savatier <tristan@creative.net>

    *	When the Netscape extension is enabled, the BASE element is no
	longer required to have an HREF attribute, since the following
	is now valid:
		<BASE TARGET="banana">
	Added a case to the testsuite.
	Reported by Tristan Savatier <tristan@creative.net>

    *	Added the PickTmpdir() routine (which was only used in test.pl)
	into weblint. This makes weblint a little smarter about picking
	a directory where temporary files should be created.

    *   Fixed the attribute format code so the ROWS and COLS attributes
        for FRAMESET are supported when the Netscape extension is enabled.
	Added a case to the test-suite.
        Reported by Chris Lambert <lambertc@sharelink.com> and
        Tristan Savatier <tristan@creative.net>

    4-april-1996 neilb

    *	Fixed the Microsoft extension stuff so that WIDTH and HEIGHT
	can be a percentage, since this is valid for things like the
	MARQUEE element.
	Reported by Keith Iosso <a-keithi@microsoft.com>

    *	Added support for some Microsoft attributes:
	    BODY:	ALINK
	    TABLE:	CELLSPACING and CELLPADDING
	Reported by Keith Iosso <a-keithi@microsoft.com>

    *	Moved the code which handles the -todo switch after the config
	file is read, since the user may have over-ridden the `url-get'
	variable in $HOME/.weblintrc.
	Patch from Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>

    10-march-1996 neilb

    *	Added a -f switch which is used to provide an explicit configuration
	file, over-riding all the other possibilities :-)

    *	Fixed a bug whereby the ID, LANG and CLASS attributes were not
	recognized for any of the logical or physical font elements,
	such as <I> and <STRONG>. For example:
		<i class=species>
		<strong class=urgent>
	Added a test case to the testsuite.
	Bug reported by Alan J. Flavell <FLAVELL@v2.ph.gla.ac.uk>

    *	Changed the 'netscape-markup' warning to a more generic
	'extension-markup' warning, and the 'netscape-attribute' warning
	to a more generic 'extension-attribute' warning. The same warning
	is generated if you use Netscape-specific markup, or Microsoft-specific
	markup.

    *	Added a new extension 'Microsoft', which makes weblint understand
	the html extensions implemented by Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
	Added a simple test case -- needs to cover more of the extensions.

    *	Fixed bug where weblint complained about illegal attribute format
	if you used the TYPE attribute for OL, with netscape extensions
	enabled. Added a test case which includes an ordered list of each
	TYPE. Bug reported by Bryan O'Sullivan <bos@serpentine.com>.

    *	Added sequence which allows you to suck system defaults in from
	within a personal config file:

		use global weblintrc

	This results in the local global configuration file being read at
	the current point. I.e. it may well over-ride settings which
	appeared before this line in the user's config file.
	This should be the first thing in your file, if you're gonna use it.
	Suggested by John F. Whitehead <jfw@wral-tv.com>.

    *	ReadConfigFile() now warns about illegal syntax in the config file.
	Previously it would be silently ignored.

    *	Changed GetConfigFile() to ReadConfigFile(), which takes a filename
	which should be interpreted as a weblint configuration file.
	If WEBLINTRC is not set, and the user doesn't have a .weblintrc,
	then weblint will now check $GLOBAL_RCFILE.

    8-march-1996 neilb

    *	Weblint now lets you have empty TD elements in a table.
	Testcase in the testsuite for this.

    24-february-1996 neilb

    *	Fixed a typo in the manpage, the "malformed heading" warning was
	included as the "malformed header" warning.
	Reported by David J. MacKenzie <djm@va.pubnix.com>

    14-february-1996 neilb

    *	In the SEE ALSO section of the manpage, the .BR macro is used for
	references.
	Patch from Erick Branderhorst <branderhorst@fgg.eur.nl>
